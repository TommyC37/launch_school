# Without looking into your notes, try to remember which primitive data types are defined in JavaScript. Then find this information on MDN.

My answers:
> Primitive data types include:<br>
> 1. Number
> 2. String
> 3. Boolean
> 4. NaN
> 5. Undefined
> 6. Objects

Corrections:
> 1. Objects are NOT primitives because they're mutable.
> 2. Did not include BigInt
> 3. Did not include Symbol
> 4. Did not include Null
> 5. NaN is NOT a primitive. It's considered a property of the global object (i.e. a variable in global scope).
